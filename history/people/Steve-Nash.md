Originally born in South Africa, Steve Nash's family immigrated to Victoria, British Columbia while he was still an infant. Son to a soccer player, Nash spent a large part of his childhood playing sports including basketball. Though originally he did not recieve interest from american colleges for a basketball scholarship, Nash eventually caught the attention of Santa Clara where he would led the Broncos to numerous sucessful NCAA runs, though always falling short of the title.

Deciding to go pro, Nash declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected 15th overall by the Phoenix Suns. Failing to make a splash during his rookie and sophomore years, he was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in 1998.

Alongside German legend Dirk Nowitzki the Dallas Mavericks progressed to the 2003 Western Conference Finals, though they fell to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs. After this dissapointment, during his free agency Nash returned to the Phoenix Suns.
